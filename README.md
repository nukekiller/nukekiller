Hi! I'm @nukekiller (a.k.a. Scotch Wichmann), an artist, filmmaker, writer, hacker, coder, researcher, and occultist working in intersections of cybersecurity, parapsychology, performance, and art. 

I'm interested in all things involving cybersecurity/hacking, the paranormal/ESP, shamanism & the occult, performance art, and avant garde film/music/technology. I've been an avid coder since 1985 (BASIC, Assembly, C, Perl, PHP, Python, Java, shell, embedded, etc.) and I love monkeying with electronics.  On a typical weekend you might find me coding new tools, breaking into computers (with permission of course), writing & shooting films, experimenting with occult & shamanic practices, running marathons, and drinking dank & musty IPAs.
